> In this video we tackle the first half of the problem of determining those simple graphs which have a finite number of root populations, in the language of the Mutation Game introduced in the previous video. This is arguably one of the very best problems for amateur mathematicians to tackle to gain an appreciation of what exploring research level maths is all about. 
> We will see how the remarkable ADE graphs arise, and also how the closely related ADE ~ graphs play an important role. However there is more to do before we are able to solve this problem completely!
