**GEOMETOR** is an open-source initiative dedicated to the exploration of
fundamental aspects of geometry, nature, and logic.

A key mission has been the development of a Python software library to create
symbolic models of classical geometric constructions


abstraction and reasoning

geometric modeling

.. At the heart is the `GEOMETOR explorer`_ - a Python library for building and
.. analyzing geometric constructions with sympbolic algebra.

All of the research and development for **GEOMETOR** is located here in a
collection of repositories. There are many, but these establish the foundation for the work:

- model_: tools for modeling geometric constructions
- render_: tools for rendering geometric constructions
- divine_: model and analyze the golden ratio
- elements_: extract and codify knowledge from the classic work
.. - explorer_: explore and interact with geometric models


patterns in nature
------------------

- pappus

  model and investigate pappus theorem

Each repository has:

- Python source code
- demo code
- source for project website
- discussion group
- log
- todo list
- MIT license

The website for each project is statically-generated and hosted through GitHub.
